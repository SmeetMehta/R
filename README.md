# R-Language
This repository is dedicated to my learnings in R language

Notes-

1) Modulo operator in R is "%%".
2) Boolean is R is "T" and "F" or "TRUE" and "FALSE". (All Upper)
3) To check the type of any variable "class()" function is used.
4) To create vectors a combine function "c()" is used.
5) We can use combine function to give lables to vector as well. 
     1) execute the following commands
     2)   roll <- c(446,488,489,436)
     3)   name <- c("Smeet","Ambu","Gunjan","Shivam")
     4)   names(roll) <- name
6) Vector functions.
     1) sum() - gives sum of all elements.
     2) prod() - gives product of all elements.
     3) mean() - gives mean.
     4) sd() - gives Standard deviation.
     5) max() - gives max in vector.
     6) min() - gives min in vector.
