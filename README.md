# R-Language
This repository is dedicated to my learnings in R language

Notes-

1) Modulo operator in R is "%%".
2) Boolean is R is "T" and "F" or "TRUE" and "FALSE". (All Upper)
3) To check the type of any variable "class()" function is used.
4) To create vectors a combine function "c()" is used.
5) We can use combine function to give lables to vector as well. 
   
  roll <- c(446,488,489,436)
  names(roll)<- c("Smeet","Ambu","Gunjan","Shivam")
  roll
  Smeet   Ambu Gunjan Shivam 
   446    488    489    436
